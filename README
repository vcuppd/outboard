                   -------------------------------
                   -- Installation Instructions --
                   -------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: If you already have the OutBoard installed, please follow the
UPGRADE instructions instead of these. 

------> Backup your config.php file! <------


STEP 1.  Unpack the outboard-X.X.tar.gz file, and change the directory 
name, (or make a symbolic link) to "outboard" off your web root:

  cd WEB_DOCUMENT_ROOT_DIRECTORY      (example: cd /opt/apache/htdocs)
  mv outboard-X.X.tar.gz  .
  tar -xvzf outboard-X.X.tar.gz       (X.X will be the version number)

OPTIONAL:
  mv outboard-X.X outboard

The URL to it should be something like this:

	http://www.someplace.com/outboard-X.X

If you changed the name of the directory to outboard, the URL will be:

	http://www.someplace.com/outboard

You will  need to make sure that the user which the web server runs as
has access to read the files in the outboard directory. In many cases,
the server runs as "apache" or "nobody", so you whould perform the 
folling commands:

	chgrp -R apache outboard-X.X
	chmod -R 755 outboard-X.X


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2. Edit the config/config.php file to match your configuration. 

You will need to at least check/set the database server name, database 
name, username, and the password for the database user. The OutBoard 
database user must have full permission to that database. (Insert, 
Delete, Select, etc.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3. Create the MySQL Database 

In the config.php file, which you should have edited in STEP 2, there
is a variable that controls to which database the OutBoard will talk.
By default, this is set to "outboard". You can keep this, in which
case you will need to make a new database by that name (or you can 
choose an existing database.) It is recommended that you use a NEW
database, and name it "outboard".

To make a new database in which to store the tables, run the following 
command:

	mysqladmin -u USERNAME --password=PASSWORD create outboard

Replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with the apropriate information for your
MySQL installation. Please refer to your MySQL documentation for
further information about how to create a database, and set permissions
on that database. 

If you have an existing database that you want to use (this is not 
recommended), make sure its information is in the config.php file.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4. Initiate the automatic table installation

At this point, the OutBoard will be ready to install the tables that
it needs in the chosen database. You just need to point your browser
to the board's URL (MAKE SURE POP-UPS ARE ENABLED!):

	http://www.somewhere.com/outboard   (or outboard-X.X [Step 0])

A new window will be created (if you have JavaScript enabled), and
you will be prompted to check the configuration. Enter a new admin
username, name, and password, and then click the Install button.

This step will FAIL if the database information at the top of the
config.php file is not correct. Errors at this point are most likely
with MySQL permissions. Check your MySQL documentation first if you
have problems at this stage. Also, read about the MySQL reload command.

As an extra security measure, RENAME the include/install.php script. 
It should not be able to run once you change the installtables 
configuration setting to false, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4a) OPTIONAL -- Install the Basic Authentication files:

By default the OutBoard will use its own internal authentication 
system. Optionally, you can have it use the Basic Authentication
information provided by an .htaccess file. 

You can create an .htaccess file (in the Outboard directory) with the 
following lines:

AuthUserFile /path_to_apache_password_file/passwd
AuthName "Outboard"
AuthType Basic
require valid-user

You can also use "require user username1 username2" as the last line. 
If you already have a usable Apache password file, point to it on
the AuthUserFile line. Refer to your Apache documentation on how to
create a password file.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 5. Access the outboard with your web browser. :-)  See STEP 1.

You will first need to login as the admin user using your chosen 
password, and create new users. 


Notes
-----

* READONLY users can login to the board, but their name will not
show up in the list, nor will they be able to change anything.

* Internal passwords (in the DB) are not used if basic authentication
is in use.

* You might have to turn off magic quotes in the php.ini file if you
get "backslash multiplication" problems.
